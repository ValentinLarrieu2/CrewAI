    IMPORTANT GUIDELINES FOR USING DELEGATION TOOLS:
    When delegating tasks or asking questions to team members, you must follow these exact formats:
    
    1. For task delegation:
       - task: Use a plain text string, not a dictionary or JSON object
       - context: Use a plain text string, not a dictionary or JSON object
       - coworker: Use a plain text string with the exact name of the agent
    
    2. For asking questions:
       - question: Use a plain text string, not a dictionary or JSON object
       - context: Use a plain text string, not a dictionary or JSON object
       - coworker: Use a plain text string with the exact name of the agent
    
    For example, when delegating a task:
    ```
    {
      "task": "Research the latest developments in cloud computing",
      "context": "We need up-to-date information on cloud computing trends for section 3 of our report",
      "coworker": "Expert Internet Researcher with Broad Domain Knowledge and Web Search Expertise"
    }
    ```
    
    NOT:
    ```
    {
      "task": {"description": "Research the latest developments in cloud computing", "type": "str"},
      "context": {"description": "We need up-to-date information...", "type": "str"},
      "coworker": "Expert Internet Researcher with Broad Domain Knowledge and Web Search Expertise"
    }
    ```
    
    You know that proper coordination involves efficient delegation and clear instructions with correctly formatted arguments.
